// The drift guard for the vendored brand layer.
//
// WHY A DETECTOR AND NOT A PACKAGE — the same argument check-shared.mjs makes,
// and it survives this case unchanged. seysays, playsey, sayyourname and
// 333.eco each have their own CI and their own deploy cadence; no module can
// span them, so a detector does. A57 originally proposed a tag-pinned git
// dependency; that was reconsidered here because a version RANGE is drift with
// a number on it, and because of the line below.
//
// NO NETWORK, NO CREDENTIALS, NO SIBLING CHECKOUT in --check mode. That is the
// reason this works where fetching a package would not: CI is
// actions/checkout@v4 + `npm ci` with no .npmrc anywhere in the estate, so the
// guard needs nothing it does not already have and cannot be disabled by a
// missing token.
//
// ⚠️ INTEGRITY IS NOT CURRENCY, and conflating them is how four repos sat three
// minor versions behind while every guard reported green. --check answers "do
// my files match MY lock" — it is local, offline, and it cannot answer "is my
// lock the current one", because a repo that has fallen behind is internally
// consistent. That was left to "an older version string shows up in a pull
// request", which is a person remembering, and on 2026-09-01 the person had not:
// package v1.3.0, all four consumers v1.0.0.
//
// So currency is a SECOND MODE with different rules, and the rules differ
// because the questions do. --currency --against <checkout> compares this
// repo's lock version to the package's. It needs the package, so it needs
// either a sibling checkout or a network fetch — which is exactly why it must
// not run in the build. It runs on a SCHEDULE, where being unable to reach
// GitHub means a red scheduled job and not a blocked deploy.
//
// brand.333.eco is a PUBLIC repository, so the scheduled workflow checks it out
// with no token, and the "cannot be disabled by a missing credential" property
// survives into the second mode intact.
//
// THREE FILES, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM DIFFERS PER REPO:
//   brand.lock       every package file -> sha256, plus a version.
//                    BYTE-IDENTICAL in every consumer. A repo that falls
//                    behind carries an older version string, which shows up as
//                    a diff in a pull request rather than as a mystery.
//   brand.uses       which files THIS repo vendors, and where they live.
//                    The one file that must differ — the same role config.ts
//                    plays in the check-shared set.
//   check-brand.mjs  this file. Byte-identical everywhere.
//
// House rules followed: node built-ins only, assertions that name the fix and
// not just the failure, and a non-zero exit that a workflow notices.
